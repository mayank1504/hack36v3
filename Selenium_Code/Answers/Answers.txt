water cycle is the process when the sea water evaporates and goes up..the evaporated water then condenses and form clouds, these clouds contain water..the water comes down in the form of rain and the level of the sea rises again..this is known as water cycle where d water goes up nd again comes down in the form of rain.
What is the water cycle?

Water cycle, also called hydrologic cycle, cycle that involves the continuous circulation of water in the Earth-atmosphere system. Of the many processes involved in the water cycle, the most important are evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. Although the total amount of water within the cycle remains essentially constant, its distribution among the various processes is continually changing.
Diagram of the Water Cycle
A brief treatment of the water cycle follows.
Evaporation, one of the major processes in the cycle, is the transfer of water from the surface of the Earth to the atmosphere. By evaporation, water in the liquid state is transferred to the gaseous, or vapour, state. This transfer occurs when some molecules in a water mass have attained sufficient kinetic energy to eject themselves from the water surface. The main factors affecting evaporation are temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation. The direct measurement of evaporation, though desirable, is difficult and possible only at point locations. The principal source of water vapour is the oceans, but evaporation also occurs in soils, snow, and ice. Evaporation from snow and ice, the direct conversion from solid to vapour, is known as sublimation.
Transpiration is the evaporation of water through minute pores, or stomata, in the leaves of plants. For practical purposes, transpiration and the evaporation from all water, soils, snow, ice, vegetation, and other surfaces are lumped together and called evapotranspiration, or total evaporation.
Water vapour is the primary form of atmospheric moisture. Although its storage in the atmosphere is comparatively small, water vapour is extremely important in forming the moisture supply for dew, frost, fog, clouds, and precipitation. Practically all water vapour in the atmosphere is confined to the troposphere (the region below 6 to 8 miles [10 to 13 km] altitude).
The transition process from the vapour state to the liquid state is called Condensation. Condensation may take place as soon as the air contains more water vapour than it can receive from a free water surface through evaporation at the prevailing temperature. This condition occurs as the consequence of either cooling or the mixing of air masses of different temperatures. By condensation, water vapour in the atmosphere is released to form precipitation.
Precipitation that falls to the Earth is distributed in four main ways: some is returned to the atmosphere by evaporation, some may be intercepted by vegetation and then evaporated from the surface of leaves, some percolates into the soil by infiltration, and the remainder flows directly as surface runoff into the sea. Some of the infiltrated precipitation may later percolat into streams as ground water runoff. Direct measurement of runoff is made by stream gauges and plotted against time on hydrographs.
Most groundwater is derived from precipitation that has percolatedthrough the soil. Groundwater flow rates, compared with those of surface water, are very slow and variable, ranging from a few millimetres to a few metres a day. Groundwater movement is studied by tracer techniques and remote sensing.
Ice also plays a role in the water cycle. Ice and snow on the Earth’s surface occur in various forms such as frost, sea ice, and glacier ice. When soil moisture freezes, ice also occurs beneath the Earth’s surface, forming permafrost in tundra climates. About 18,000 years ago glaciers and ice caps covered approximately one-third of the Earth’s land surface. Today about 12 percent of the land surface remains covered by ice masses.

In, cycle of water there is five major processes work together to keep Earth's water moving in a cycle.The five processes at work in the hydrologic cycle. These are condensation, precipitation, infiltration, runoff, and evapotranspiration. These occur simultaneously an except for precipitation, continuously.These five processes are as follows- condensation, precipitation, infiltration, runoff, and evapotranspiration- together make up the Hydrologic Cycle of water. Water vapor condenses to form clouds, which result in precipitation when the conditions are suitable mode. Precipitation falls ...
What is the cycle of water?
The water cycle describes the continuous movement of water on, above and below the surface of the Earth. The mass of water on Earth remains fairly constant over time but the partitioning of the water into the major reservoirs of ice, fresh water, saline water and atmospheric water is variable depending on a wide range of climatic variables. The water moves from one reservoir to another, such as from river to ocean, or from the ocean to the atmosphere, by the physical processes of evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, surface runoff, and subsurface flow. In doing so, the wa...
The water cycle represents the circulation and recycling of water in nature. Liquid water on the planet surface is heated by the sun and turns into water vapor that gains the atmosphere. In the atmosphere, large volumes of water vapor form cloud that when cooled precipitate liquid water as rain. Therefore water comes back to the planet surface and the cycle is completed. As possible steps of the cycle, water may still be stored in subterranean reserves or in the form of ice in mountains and oceans and it may also be used in the metabolism of living beings, incorporated into the body of the ...

The way that water moves all around the earth as it changes it's state is called water cycle. Water in oceans and rivers evaporates and becomes water vapour. As water vapour rises in the air, it cools and condenses into tiny droplets. These tiny droplets accumulate and form clouds. Large water droplets fall back to the earth as rainfall. Water from the rainfall either is absorbed into the ground or runs off into rivers. Water absorbed into ground becomes ground water. Water that runs off into rivers flows to sea where it evaporates back into the air.
The water cycle is like a life cycle for water. It involves collected water, such as in an ocean, evaporating. Also, water evaporates out of plants into the air through stomata. This is called transpiration. The water in the air is a gas, now called water vapour. Because the sky gets colder as you go up, the water vapour cools to the dew point and condenses, returning to a liquid state. The condensed water forms clouds. When the clouds get too heavy, rain begins to fall. This is called precipitation. When the precipitation hits the ground, it can do one of two things. It can infiltrate, or ...
