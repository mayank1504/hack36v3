# hack36v3
This project is hack for eliminating the enormous manual work needed to be done by students when they want to verify or evaluate themselves on the basis of their performance on previous year or assignment papers.
In this we aim that once a person wants to evaluate his/her work he must not have to go and search for each and every individual question on google.</br>
Our app will scan the assignments uploaded by students and curate the best answers possible in a well decorated manner for direct evaluation.</br></br>

  Ideas:
  The basic idea behind this android application is to provide us a multi-way interface for the ease of students to save time while surfing questions one by one over google.
We always want things to be done with the minimum amount of input required .
This would not only reduce the time in surfing but also provide teachers a platform for recommended answers which can be further be used in evaluation of answer sheets.
In future for covering a large audience we also decided to add one more feature to it  that it would provide comparison between the recommended answers and the students answers .
So that the teacher don't have to waste time on copies which have a very high match and would give time for copies with low match.
There would be a section for favourites and quizzes based on the most searched topics.
