# hack36v3
This project is hack for eliminating the enormous manual work needed to be done by students when they want to verify or evaluate themselves on the basis of their performance on previous year or assignment papers.
In this we aim that once a person wants to evaluate his/her work he must not have to go and search for each and every individual question on google.</br>
Our app will scan the assignments uploaded by students and curate the best answers possible in a well decorated manner for direct evaluation.</br></br>
